---

## ❌ WHAT WE DON'T HAVE (the blueprint gaps)

### 1. Quotes System — ✅ BUILT (Phase 4)
> Pros can submit structured quotes with pricing (fixed/estimate/hourly), scope, exclusions, and revision history.

**Implementation (2026-03-01):**
- `quotes` table with RLS (pro insert/read/update own, client read/update on own jobs, admin full)
- Quote statuses: submitted → revised → accepted → rejected → withdrawn
- Client accepts quote → assigns pro + moves job to `in_progress`
- Realtime enabled for live updates
- Soft deletes added to `forum_posts` and `forum_replies` (deleted_at/deleted_by)
- Full i18n (EN + ES) for all quote UI strings

---

### 2. Payments & Escrow — NOT BUILT
> No Stripe integration, no payment processing, no escrow.

**Blueprint proposes:**
- `payment_intents` (Stripe integration)
- `escrow_ledger` (held → released → refunded)
- `milestones` (deposit + staged release for construction)

**Do we need it?** 🟡 **DECISION NEEDED**
- Payments through platform = commission revenue but regulatory complexity
- Payments offline = simpler but no monetization control
- **Recommendation:** Start with Stripe Connect in a later phase once job volume justifies it

---

### 3. Formal Disputes System — NOT BUILT
> We have `support_requests` (tickets) but not a structured dispute resolution system tied to payments.

**Blueprint proposes:**
- `disputes` table (reason_code, evidence, mediation status, resolution)
- Tied to escrow (release / refund / partial)

**Do we need it?** 🔴 **Only if payments are on-platform**
- Without escrow, disputes are just support tickets (which we already have)
- With escrow, disputes become critical — must block fund release

---

### 4. Flags / Fraud Detection — NOT BUILT (partially)
> We have `flags` array on jobs (rules engine) but no standalone flags/reports table for users/content.

**Blueprint proposes:**
- `flags` table (entity_type, entity_id, flag_type, reporter, status)
- Flag types: fraud, spam, abusive, duplicate

**Do we need it?** 🟢 **Yes, but low priority**
- Current support_requests partially covers this
- A dedicated flags table would help with automated detection patterns

---

### 5. Soft Deletes — NOT IMPLEMENTED
> Current delete operations are hard deletes (e.g., `removeContent` actually DELETEs forum posts).

**Blueprint recommends:** Soft delete everything (add `deleted_at` columns).

**Do we need it?** 🟢 **Yes, recommended for audit trail**
- Forum content: should soft-delete for moderation review
- Jobs: already use status transitions (effectively soft-delete via `cancelled`/`archived`)
- Users: suspension exists, but no soft-delete on profiles

---

### 6. Rate Limiting — NOT IMPLEMENTED
> No server-side rate limits on job posts/day, quotes/day, login attempts.

**Do we need it?** 🟢 **Yes, add via RLS or edge function middleware**
- Prevents spam job posting
- Prevents abuse of messaging system

---

### 7. Detailed Review Dimensions — PARTIAL
> We have `rating` + `comment` but NOT the multi-dimensional ratings from the blueprint.

**Blueprint proposes:** `communication_rating`, `reliability_rating`, `workmanship_rating`

**Do we need it?** 🟡 **Nice to have**
- Current single rating + comment is fine for MVP
- Multi-dimensional helps pros improve and helps clients compare

## 🎯 THE BIG DECISION

Your platform is currently a **matchmaker + lead-gen** model:
> Client posts job → Pros see it → They message → Deal happens offline

The blueprint describes a **full transactional marketplace**:
> Client posts → Pro quotes → Client accepts → Payment through platform → Escrow → Release

**You're at the fork.** Everything in Phases 1–3.5 is built and solid. The question is:

### Do you want to add on-platform payments?

**If YES:** Build Quotes → Stripe Connect → Escrow → Disputes (Phases 4–5)
**If NO:** Your backend is essentially complete. Focus on UX polish, SEO, and growth.

---

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

1. **Don't build payments yet.** Get job volume first. Payments add massive complexity (Stripe Connect, escrow law, refund handling).
2. **Do build a simple Quotes table** — even without payments, letting pros submit structured quotes on-platform (price, scope, timeline) dramatically improves the experience vs. raw messaging.
3. **Do add soft deletes** — cheap insurance for moderation.
4. **Do add rate limiting** — protects against spam as you grow.
5. **Skip disputes and escrow** until payments are live.
6. **Skip multi-dimensional reviews** — current system works fine.

### Recommended Next Phase: "Structured Quotes (no payments)"
- `quotes` table (price, scope, timeline, status)
- Quote submission flow for pros
- Quote comparison view for clients
- "Accept quote" → assigns pro to job
- Admin visibility into quotes
